#BCS App Documentation for Apple iOS and Google Android

##Installation

The BCS App is essentially a website that you can use even when you are offline. 

An active internet connection is required to Sync or Email records.

This does not sync the records with MINDA. To sync the records with MINDA, a CSV file must be send to an email address and then uploaded via MINDA Pro.

To save the app to your phone or tablet so you can use it offline, follow these steps:

###Installation for Apple iOS

1. Open the Safari browser on your iPhone or iPad

2. Once the page has loaded, save the page as a bookmark to your home screen  

  - Once the page has loaded, in the middle of the bottom of the screen click on the "Share" button (box with an arrow pointing upwards), and select "Add to homescreen"

  - Hit "Add" in the top right corner

  - An icon will appear on your homescreen


3. Once the link has been added to your mobile device, open it to load the app for the first time

4. The app is now ready to be used, both with and without an internet connection

###Installation for Google Android Users

1. Open the Chrome browser on your Google Android device

2. Once the page has loaded, save the page as a bookmark to your home screen

#BCS App Documentation for Installing on a Web Server

1. Install NodeJs (for ease of use, although not required as I've commited the entire node_modules directory!)  

2. Install forever (npm install -g forever) or whatever continuous uptime
